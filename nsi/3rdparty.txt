QLandkarte GT for Windows (short: QLGT) depends on the 3rd party software listed below

See the Wiki on compile instructions:
http://sourceforge.net/p/qlandkartegt/qlandkartegt/Compiling_QLandkarte_GT_on_Windows/


1.) Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package
  The installer vcredist_x86.exe (ca 4MB size) as downloaded from
    http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=A5C84275-3B97-4AB7-A40D-3802B2AF5FC2&displaylang=en
  is contained in the QLGT Installer package and may be executed if selected by the user.
  Note: Those runtime libraries are already contained in Windows Vista or Windows 7 installations.
  Therefore they typically need only be installed on some Windows XP machines.

2.) Qt runtime libraries
  The Qt DLL's are deployed in the QLGT installation directory. 
  They  are part of the "Qt libraries for Windows (VS 2008)" package.
  This can be retrieved from http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/windows-cpp-vs2008.

3.) The GDAL SDK packaged by Tamas Szekeres.
  This be obtained from http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk/.

4.) libjpeg
  The libjpeg.lib and header files are needed to compile the helper program map2gcm.exe
  The source code can be downloaded as jpegsr8b.zip from http://www.ijg.org/
 
5.) stdint.h
  The stdint.h is needed to compile the helper program map2gcm.exe
  stdint.h can be downloaded from http://msinttypes.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/stdint.h 
  as referenced in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stdint.h
 
6.) Icons for the Windows Start Menu
  a) GlobeWin.ico has been provided by Roland Hahn
  b) kfm_home.ico, kget.ico, khelpcenter.ico, konsole.ico, xmag.ico 
     have been created from the Nuvola 1.0 icon set (http://www.icon-king.com/projects/nuvola/)
 
7.) Optional at run-time: libexif
  The libexif-12.dll is only needed to extract location information from pictures (jpg, maybe others).
  The source code can be downloaded at http://libexif.sourceforge.net/
  As a convenience for the user, it is deployed in the QLGT installation directory.
  As a convenience for the QLGT windows build manager, the libexif-12.dll binary was not compiled from scratch 
  but copied from a GIMP 2.6.8 installation (download at http://www.gimp.org/windows/).

8.) Optional at run-time: gpsbabel
  To be able to load geodata from file types other than .gpx, gpsbabel.exe must be available in the search path. 
  GPSBabel can be downloaded at http://www.gpsbabel.org/.
  
9.) Optional at compile time: libdmtx  
  libdmtx can be downloaded at http://www.libdmtx.org/
  In the QLGT windows binaries, libdmtx 0.7.2 is statically linked.
  To create a static .lib, the configuration type of libdmtx in 
    libdmtx-0.7.2\project\visualc9\libdmtx.vcproj
  has been changed accordingly (with the VS2008 GUI) from dynamic lib to static lib.
