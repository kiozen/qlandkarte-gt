Qt TimeZone Interface - README
========================================

This is a wrapper library for Qt around the Olsen Time Zone Database
data. The code itself is not a port of tzcode, but a completely fresh
implementation of the same algorithms for the Qt environment.

The library can read TZ DB's compiled time zone DB files.
It transforms unix timestamps, its own format and QDateTime objects.

Other than the original tzcode package it can be compiled out of the
box with Qt for Windows and integrates well with Qt.

Big Fat Warning
------------------

So far this software is beta. This means it might calculate the wrong time,
corrupt your data, eat your disk, misplace next weeks appointments, etc.
ad infinitum, ad nauseam, ...

This software comes with no warranty at all. You use it at your own risk.


Building it
-------------

To create the library simply call:
qmake
make

Source Documentation:
1) can be built with calling doxygen
2) you'll find the documentation in sourcedoc

See db/README for details on how to change/update the built-in database files.

If you want to build the library without the built-in database:
1) call genemptyrcc.sh
2) call make to rebuild the library

See the generated source docu for usage details.
