README for TZ DB
=================

This directory contains just the tzdata files and parts of the Makefile
from tzcode. You can download newer versions from
http://www.iana.org/time-zones (formerly ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/)

This data is in the public domain.

To update the database automatically from IANA call "sh update.sh" (you'll
need rsync for this).

If you want to rebuild the built-in database manually:
1) drop new zone description files (tzdata*.tar.gz) in the db subdirectory, if
   some of the new files were not present previously you may need to tweek the
   Makefile;
   do not forget to adjust version.txt to reflect the version you just installed
2) simply call genrcc.sh  in the main directory - it will go into the db
   directory and rebuild the database files, then it will include them into
   the zonefiles.qrc/cpp files.
3) Then call make in the main directory to rebuild the library.

You will need a working shell, make and the zic tool. I recommend doing this
on a Linux box, since they usually have all these tools installed. With some
work a MSYS or Cygwin installation might work as well.
